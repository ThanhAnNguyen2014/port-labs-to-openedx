#+TITLE: Portable Media - Personal Edition
#+DATE: <2016-09-14 Wed>

* Introduction
  This document describes building a *Personal Edition* with the labs
  that are ported onto Open edX platform.
** Objective 
   Build the Personal-Edition, that should have open edx platform
   installed and ported labs( Labs that are hosted on AWS VMs). So
   that the labs can be accessible locally(from Personal edition)
   without internet.

* Requirements 
** Functional  Requirements 
   - Labs that are ported to personal edition should be available in
     one box/machine without depending on the internet.
     + Hard drive with the Open edX platform and 65 labs ported on it
     + Vagrant box with the Open edX platform and 65 labs ported on it  
** System Requirements
   - Operating System : Ubutnu 14.04 LTS
     As we are using it for the open edx platform on production (AWS)
   - RAM : 16 GB
   - Hard Drive : 250 GB for SSD or 400-500 for Magnetic.

* Design
** Linux box in a Hard drive
   A Hard disk will have Open edX platform setup, once the setup is
   ready, take the labs from github and host/deploy them in
   local(Localhost). So that hosted labs can be accessible from edx
   platform without depending on the internet.
   
** Vagrant Box
   A Vagrant Box will have Open edX platform setup, once the setup is
   ready, take the labs from github and host/deploy them in
   local(Localhost). So that hosted labs can be accessible from edx
   platform without depending on the internet.

* Implementation 
** Vagrant Box as a Portable edition 
   Steps:
   - Install [[http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html][Vagrant]] 1.6.5 or later 
   - Install [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]] 4.3.12 or later
   - Create a Vagrant box with the Ubutnu-14.04 LTS
   - Install Open edX platform
   - Import/Port labs to Open edX platform
   - Host/deploy the labs on vagrant box and make these labs available
     to edx platform.

** Hard drive as a Portable edition 
   Steps:
   - Install Ubuntu-14.04 LTS
   - Install Open edX platform on it
   - Import/Port labs to Open edX platform
   - Host/deploy the labs on local machine and make these labs available
     to edx platform.

* Memory Leakage labs
  - What could be the solution for hosting memory leakage labs on
    personal edition? 
    
    Solution could be:
    for Vagrant box *Vagrant box down* and *vagrant box up* and 
    for Personal edition, *shutdown and restart the machine*

  - How to find out the labs that are causing the memory leakage? 
  - Can we create OpenVZ/Docker containers for the memory leakage
    labs? is it a good idea?
