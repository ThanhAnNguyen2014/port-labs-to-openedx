* Status as of July 11, 2016
+ [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/issues/27][Overall Plan for upcoming releases]]
+ [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/milestone/2][Release 2 : Porting of labs, customized analytics and customized theming]]

+ [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/milestone/4][Release 4 : Virtual labs integration workshop]]

** What are we confident with it ?
+ Setting up LMS and apply basic theming on edX
+ Port existing converted labs to Open edX
+ Converting current labs to Open edX 

** What are we facing problem in ?
+ Setting up Analytics (Even though we were able to reproduce after taking help from Dr. Ramesh same steps never worked and we added new)
+ We were able to acheive analytics for an instance. Same steps are not getting analytics again.
+ Our lack of knowledge of all the components used in Open edX.
+ A problem and issue is hard to coorelate with the component because of complex structure. 
+ Lack of proper documentation and support for complex tasks. Many of our emails and queries are unanswered.


** Problems faced -
+ Setting up Analytics Data API server ::
+ Execution of remote tasks ::
+ Setting up Analytics ::
