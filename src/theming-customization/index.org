
* Strategy
Efforts in theming and customization are carried in three different ways -
** Theming in dogwood 0 - Sripathi
** Theming in dogwood 2 - Ashay
** Editing source code  - Ashay/Sripathi  

* Introduction
This document briefly explaines the process of customizting the themes,
* Changing theme on dogwood0
** Procedure to change the theme of OpenEdx LMS
** The manual way
   Source :: [[https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Stanford-Theming#manual-method][Stanford Theme]]

   1. Clone the theme [[https://github.com/vlead/default.git][repository]] to the /edx/app/edxapp/themes/ location, if
      =themes= directory is not present, create one. 
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ls /edx/app/edxapp/themes
      mkdir /edx/app/edxapp/themes
      cd /edx/app/edxapp/themes
      git clone https://github.com/vlead/default.git
      #+END_EXAMPLE

   2. Modify /edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json, and set 
      a. FEATURES.USE_CUSTOM_THEME to 'true'
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "USE_CUSTOM_THEME": true
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      b.THEME_NAME to 'default' (the name of the cloned directory)
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "THEME_NAME": "default",
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      c. PLATFORM_NAME to 'VLEAD'
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "PLATFORM_NAME": "VLEAD",
      #+END_EXAMPLE

   3. Recompile the [[https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Managing+OpenEdX+Tips+and+Tricks][assets]].  

      Open this [[https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Managing+OpenEdX+Tips+and+Tricks][link]] and search for the section 'Compile assets manually" and
      execute all the steps except for the 'cms'.

   4. Restart the services 
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      sudo /edx/bin/supervisorctl restart all
      #+END_EXAMPLE

* Changing theme on dogwood2
* Customization using 
** By changing configuration files
** By editing source code
