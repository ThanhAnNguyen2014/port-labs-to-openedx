#+Title: Document to apply theming and customization in open-edX platform


* Introduction and Strategy 
We tried 3 approaches in applying theming and customization in open-edX platform.
Those 3 approaches are in given below -

+ Theming in dogwood 0 - This includes applying basic Standford theming. It can only help in theming basic templates.
+ Theming in dogwood 2 - With latest dogwood-2 release, theming procdure is expected to change. We are 
                         unable to install dogwood-2 and hence this approach is yet to be tried.
+ Editing source code  - The high level of customization, like editing/adding/removing text on web pages can be acheived
                         using editing text in source code. This approach is not a feasible way as editing source code 
                         can cause issues in version control, and updations.

* Changing theme in dogwood0
Please follow the steps given below to apply theme.
Source :: [[https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Stanford-Theming#manual-method][Stanford Theme]]

   1. Clone the theme [[https://github.com/vlead/default.git][repository]] to the /edx/app/edxapp/themes/ location, if
      =themes= directory is not present, create one. 
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ls /edx/app/edxapp/themes
      mkdir /edx/app/edxapp/themes
      cd /edx/app/edxapp/themes
      git clone https://github.com/vlead/default.git
      #+END_EXAMPLE

   2. Modify /edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json, and set 
      a. FEATURES.USE_CUSTOM_THEME to 'true'
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "USE_CUSTOM_THEME": true
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      b.THEME_NAME to 'default' (the name of the cloned directory)
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "THEME_NAME": "default",
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      c. PLATFORM_NAME to 'VLEAD'
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "PLATFORM_NAME": "VLEAD",
      #+END_EXAMPLE

   3. Recompile the [[https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Managing+OpenEdX+Tips+and+Tricks][assets]].  

      Open this [[https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Managing+OpenEdX+Tips+and+Tricks][link]] and search for the section 'Compile assets manually" and
      execute all the steps except for the 'cms'.

   4. Restart the services 
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      sudo /edx/bin/supervisorctl restart all
      #+END_EXAMPLE

* Changing theme on dogwood2
Dogwood-2 latest release looked promising with more cutomization options. Comprehensive theming is possible in dogwood both 
for LMS and CMS. We tried installing dogwood-2 on AWS VM, but failed. One of the 8 service was not getting started, as a result, 
Server error was faced. We posted this question to comunity and waiting for response.

* Custmoization by editing source code

*** Adding an image on Registration page
This is fixed editing source code. We are not going to use this mode of customization.

*** Removing extra labels on edX from studio and other pages
This [[http://edx-courses.vlabs.ac.in:18010/signup]][link]] contains some
text "EdX, Open edX, Studio, and the edX and Open edX logos are

*** Changing site name(fixing the activation email link which comes with http://localhost*)
- Open the file =cms.env.json= file using =vim /edx/app/edxapp/cms.env.json=
  and change the variable name =SITE_NAME= to SITE_NAME="edx-courses.vlabs.ac.in"
- Change the same variable value at =vim /edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json=

*** Adding/attaching external websites with edX
Read [[https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Alternate-site-for-marketing-links][document]] for enabling external sites in edX platform.
We used [[https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Alternate-site-for-marketing-links#to-run-without-an-alternate-marketing-site][steps given at]]

#+begin_src command
1. Login into edX VM as user =ubuntu=
2. sudo su -
3. cd /edx/app/edxapp/
4. open lms.env.json file and set "ENABLE_MKTG_SITE": true
5. opem cms.env.json file and set  "ENABLE_MKTG_SITE": true
6. We can add more sections to it.

#+begin_src command
"MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP": {
        "TOS": "tos",
        "ROOT": "root",
        "HONOR": "honor"
        },

#+end_src
7. Open the default page IP/tos which will open a default terms and condtions page
8. locate the file containing the text displayed by link. Using grep command we identified as tos.html
9. locate tos.html
10. vim themes/default/templates/static_templates/theme-tos.html
11. Edit this file to customize your terms and conditions.
#+end_src

*** Changing default example.com emails in edX
#+begin_src command
1. Login to edX VM.
2. sudo su -
3. cd /edx/app/edxapp/
4. open lms.env.json file and replace all example.com emails with appropriate respective emails 
5. Save changed and restart services using command /edx/bin/supervisorctl restart all
#+end_src

#+begin_src command
1. Login to edX VM
2. sudo su -
3. cd /edx/app/edxapp/
4. locate register.html

Read the source of reister.html.

**** Searched a specific string on registration page 
Search for string =I agree to the VLEAD Terms of Service and Honor Code. *= 
#+begin_src command
1. Login into edX VM as user =ubuntu=
2. sudo su -
3. cd /edx/app/edxapp/
4. grep -iRn "I agree to the VLEAD Terms of Service and Honor Code. *" *

#+end_src 

Got a list of files from where this string was getting served from.  Changes
