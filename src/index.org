* Introduction
  This document deals with : 
  + Installation of Open edX platform
  + Porting a virtual lab to Open edX platform
  + On how different features of the Open edX platform - persistence, single
    sign, analytics - are leveraged by Virtual Labs

* Requirements
  1. Virtual Labs has a single sign on.  All the virtual labs are accessible
     using a single sign on.
  2. A user upon re-logging to virtual labs is returned to the same state that
     the user was in before logging out of virtual labs.
  3. User action data is captured that enables building various analytics.


* COMMENT Setting up Open edX platform on Vagrant
*** COMMENT Setup the fullstack
    fullstack of Open edX is setup using vagrant on developers' machines.

** COMMENT Creating a course

* Setting up Open edX platform on AWS
** Launch instance on AWS
*** Launch instance from Community AMI
   - Choose AMI from "Community AMI"
     + Chosen ami-ad161ee8
     + Configure Instance details 
       - Network details ( Use appropriate VPC)
       - Enable "Auto-assign Public IP""
     + Add Storage
       - Choose Volume type as "Magnetic"
       - Given 40 GB 
     + Choose appropriate "Security Group"
     + Boot From "Magnetic disk"
     + Launch Instance
   - Use the Public IP of that instance to see the web console of
     Open edX platform 
   - edX platform runs on tcp 80 and 18010 port numbers
     + port 80 is to see the default edx web console
     + If we want to see the edX studio web console, use 18010 port
       number
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       public_ip:18010
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     + Use satff@example.com as user email-id and edx as password for
       logging into edx studio and to make changes in courses
*** Launch instance from AWS marketplace
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from AWS Marketplace
     + Chosen AMI Name : Open edX powered by Bitnami (HVM).
     + Linux/Unix, Ubuntu 14.04.3 | 64-bit Amazon Machine Image
       (AMI) | Updated: 1/22/16
     + Choose an Instance Type
       - t2.medium 
       - vCPUs: 2
       - Memory(RAM): 4GB 
     + Configure Instance details 
       - Network details ( Use appropriate VPC)
       - Enable "Auto-assign Public IP""
     + Add Storage
       - Choose Volume type as "Magnetic"
       - Given 40 GB 
     + Choose appropriate "Security Group"
     + Boot From "Magnetic disk"
     + Launch Instance
   - Use the Public IP of that instance to see the web console of
     Open edX platform 
   - edX platform runs on tcp 80 and 18010 port numbers
     + port 80 is to see the default edx web console
     + If we want to see the edX studio web console, use 18010 port
       number
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       public_ip:18010
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     + NOTE :: Still there are some issues in this VM. such as
               configuring sendmail by giving smtp server and
               database if it uses, etc. Still we need to look into
               those things. For now we have running edX Platform to
               host labs on edX platform. 
            
** Launch Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit on AWS and setup Open edX Platform
   - Launch an Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit on AWS 
     Minimum Requirements as follows for setting up Open edX platform
     + Instance Type: t2.medium
     + RAM : 4 GB
     + Hard Disk : 50 GB
   - SSH to launched instance using 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ssh -i "Open edX.pem" ubuntu@ec2-54-153-2-214.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Update and upgrade instance
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     sudo apt-get update -y  
     sudo apt-get upgrade -y
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Reboot the instance 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     sudo reboot
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Automated Installation scripts
     + Install Open edX release 
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     export OPENEDX_RELEASE=named-release/cypress
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edx/configuration/master/util/install/ansible-bootstrap.sh -O - | sudo bash     
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edx/configuration/master/util/install/sandbox.sh -O - | bash     
     #+END_SRC
   - NOTE :: In second script, edx_ansible role is trying to check
             out to release of edx_ansible but it is unable to do
             that. I have tried many times running second script but
             no result.
