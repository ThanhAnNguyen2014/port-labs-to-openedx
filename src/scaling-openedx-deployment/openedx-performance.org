#+TITLE: Load/Performance test on Open edX platform 

* Introduction
  This documnets tells how to test load on web server using siege tool.
  *siege* is load/stress tester on web server.

  Performance test will be done on home page of Open edX platform.

* Requirements
  - Capture the threshold value, so that Open edX platform can handle
    up to the threshold value requests.
  - Capture the RAM usage when number of concurrent users hitting the server
  - Capture the CPU utilization when number concurrent users hitting
    the server
* Implementation   
  Install siege. We can also use ab(apache benchmark) and locust.io.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  yum/apt-get install siege
  #+END_EXAMPLE

** RAM and CPU utilization
   |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------|
   | Command                                         | RAM used  |  CPU |
   |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------|
   | siege -c 100 -r 1 http://platform.vlabs.ac.in/  | No change |  20% |
   |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------|
   | siege -c 200 -r 1 http://platform.vlabs.ac.in/  | No change |  30% |
   |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------|
   | siege -c 500 -r 1 http://platform.vlabs.ac.in/  | No change |  70% |
   |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------|
   | siege -c 700 -r 1 http://platform.vlabs.ac.in/  | No change | 100% |
   |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------|
   | siege -c 1000 -r 1 http://platform.vlabs.ac.in/ | No change | 100% |
   |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------|

   where 
   -c num - CONCURRENT, allows you to set the concurrent number
   of simulated users to num. The number of simulated users is limited
   to the resources on the computer running siege. 

   -r NUM - allows you to run the siege for NUM repetitions

   Once Cpu is reached to 100% it fluctuates the CPU utilization based
   on in coming requests 

** Summary
   - System can allow 500 - 750 users to login 
   - Average Transaction rate: ~50 trans/sec 
   - After login, 125-175 users can use the system simultaneously

** Sample Performance test with 100 concurrent users and 1 repetition
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   siege -c 100 -r 1 http://platfrom.vlabs.ac.in/

   where 
   -c num - CONCURRENT, allows you to set the concurrent number of simulated users to num. The number of simulated users is limited to the resources on the computer running siege.
   -r NUM -  allows you to run the siege for NUM repetitions

    Transactions
          The number of server hits.  In the example, 1000 simulated users [ -c100 ] each hit the server 1 times
          [ -r1 ], a total of 1000 transactions. It is possible for the number of transactions to  exceed  the
          number  of  hits that were scheduled. Siege counts every server hit a transaction, which means redi‐
          rections and authentication challenges count as two hits, not one. With this regard,  siege  follows
          the HTTP specification and it mimics browser behavior.

   Availability
          This is the percentage of socket connections successfully handled by the server. It is the result of
          socket failures (including timeouts) divided by the sum of all connection attempts. This number does
          not  include  400  and 500 level server errors which are recorded in "Failed transactions" described
          below.

   Elapsed time
         The duration of the entire siege test.  This is measured from the time the user invokes siege  until
          the  last  simulated  user  completes its transactions.  Shown above, the test took  1.28 secs to complete.

   Data transferred
          The sum of data transferred to every siege simulated user.  It includes the  header  information  as
          well  as  content.   Because  it  includes  header information, the number reported by siege will be
          larger then the number reported by the server. In internet mode, which hits random URLs in a config‐
          uration file, this number is expected to vary from run to run.

   Response time
          The average time it took to respond to each simulated user's requests.

   Transaction rate
          The average number of transactions the server was able to handle per second, in a nutshell: transac‐
          tions divided by elapsed time.

   Throughput
          The average number of bytes transferred every second from the server to all the simulated users.

   Concurrency
          The average number  of  simultaneous  connections,  a  number  which  rises  as  server  performance
          decreases.

   Successful transactions
          The number of times the server responded with a return code < 400.

   Failed transactions
          The number of times the server responded with a return code >= 400 plus the sum of all failed socket
          transactions which includes socket timeouts.

   Longest transaction
          The greatest amount of time that any single transaction took, out of all transactions.
