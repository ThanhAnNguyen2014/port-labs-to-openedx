* Introduction
  The future of learning is very much hitched to the MOOC format.  The success
  depends on the quality and ease of creation of content.  Therefore it is
  imperative that we compare all the available MOOC platforms while allowing us
  to choose the right MOOC platform in context of India.

* Different MOOC platforms

  What each one says about themselves:

  - [[https://open.edx.org/][Open edX]] :: Open edX is the open source platform that powers edX courses.
                edX code is freely available to the community.  Institutions
                can host their own instances of Open edX and offer their own
                classes.  Educators can extend the platform to build learning
                tools that precisely meet their needs.  And developers can
                contribute new features to the Open edX platform.

  - [[https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/][GCB]] :: Google Course Builder Course Builder is an Open Source online
           education platform.  It is used to create online courses.  It runs
           on Google infrastructure

  - [[https://moodle.org/][Moodle]] :: Moodle is a free, online Learning Management system enabling
              educators to create their own private website filled with dynamic
              courses that extend learning, any time, anywhere.

  - [[https://sakaiproject.org/][Sakai]] :: A vibrant, international community that collaborates to create
             technology that enhances teaching, learning and research.  Our
             member organizations include large universities and small
             colleges, K-12 systems, hospitals, government organizations,
             research societies and political parties.

   - All the platforms provide a way to author the content of a course.  The
     'content' that can be developed for a course is always text and media -
     either video or audio in all the frameworks except Open edX.

   - Open edX authoring platform provides more than putting text and media
     together to form the content of a course.  It allows to build rich and
     engaging content by a slew of web applications - all having access to the
     course content and data.  The access to course content and data by these
     web applications is achieved by incorporating components using [[https://open.edx.org/xblocks][XBlocks]]
     component architecture.
   
   - Google Course Builder provides a [[https://github.com/google/coursebuilder_xblock_module][plugin]] for XBlocks.

   - Sakai provides a [[https://sakai.rutgers.edu/helpdocs/webcontent.html]['web content tool']] - a feature that allows external web
     content browsing as part of the course.  The external web content will not
     have access to the course content or data.

* Hosting
    
     |----------+----------+---------------+--------+-------|

     | Hosting  | Yes      | Yes           | Yes    | Yes   |

     |----------+----------+---------------+--------+-------|

     - Open edX :: Ability to host the courses either on AWS cloud or on a
                   private instance.  If the course is hosted on a private
                   cloud, the private cloud is responsible for scaling.

     - GCB ::  The GCB is tightly coupled with google's app engine (hosting
               platform) and google's PAAS cloud offering. The scaling is taken
               care by the Google cloud.  This [[http://blog.tfd.co.uk/2012/09/15/google-coursebuilder-a-scalable-course-delivery-platform/][blog]] captures more information.

     - Sakai :: Sakai provides a hosting platform.  The course can be hosted on
                VMs running the sakai platform.  There are also [[https://sakaiproject.org/try-sakai][private players]]
                who can host sakai courses.

     - Moodle :: Moodle's hosting environment can be created and hosted on a
                 private cloud.

* Licensing

     |-----------+----------+---------------+--------+----------|
     | Licensing | [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html][AGPL 3]]   | [[http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0][Apache 2]]      | [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GPL]]    | [[http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0][Apache 2]] |

     |-----------+----------+---------------+--------+----------|

     - A quick [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6999004/affero-gpl-version-3-vs-apache-licence-2-0][overview]] of AGPL V3 and Apache V2
       
       The AGPLv3 is more copyleft than Apache 2.0. It requires that all
       modifications, derived works and more must be distributed in source form
       if the work is distributed, or hosted as a publicly-accessible service
       (eg, a web application). The AGPLv3 license must be retained in all
       these derived works.

       Apache 2.0 license doesn't have many restrictions at all. You can distribute
       modified or derived Apache 2.0 works under other licenses, even
       proprietary ones. There is no requirement for you to release the source
       for a hosted service, or even an application distributed to others.

* Learning Tools Interoperability
  |-----+----------+---------------+--------+-------|
  |     | Open Edx | Google Course | Moodle | Sakai |

  | LTI | Yes      | Yes           | Yes    | Yes   |
  |     |          |               |        |       |
  |-----+----------+---------------+--------+-------|

  [[https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability][LTI]] allows a course developed in one learning tool to be incorporated in
  another.  All the above platforms are working towards this end. 

* Other Features
  All the platforms support user authentication, analytics, persistence, LMS in
  some form or the other.

  A good [[https://open.edx.org/blog/what-makes-open-edx-platform-unique-see-these-cases][read]] on what makes Open edX unique.

* Conclusion
  - GCB, Sakai, Moodle are course builders that support authoring content made
    up of text and media (video and audio).  Only Open edX supports creating
    interactive content using XBlocks and JsInput.   

  - Google has started [[http://google-opensource.blogspot.in/2013/09/we-are-joining-open-edx-platform.html][contributing]] to open edX platform.  The view of Google
    is to kick start mooc.org to provide a hosting platform for courses
    developed on Open edX platform.

  - GCB tightly couples hosting to Google's PAAS cloud offering.  While all
    other MOOC platforms do not tightly bind hosting to a specific cloud.

  - Courses on edx.org are built on Open edX platform and edx.org is one of the
    most popular MOOC offerings along with Coursera and Udacity.

  - The largest deployment of MOOCs on an open platform is Open edX platform.
