* Introduction

  Analytics provide the user activity while using virtual labs on Open edX
  platform.  This data allows an insight into the usage of virtual labs that
  could be used for various purposes.  

* Architecture of Open edX Analytics Gathering

  [[http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-installing-configuring-and-running/en/latest/_images/Analytics_Pipeline.png][Architecture Diagram]]

  Capturing of Analytics is three phased.  
  1. LMS, read as Open edX platfrom from which the labs are run, captures the
     events of a user.
  2. Pipeline reads this data from the platform, collates and creates a store
     in a format that could be read by an API.
  3. edx Analytics Data API provides an HTTP interface to access the store
     created by the Pipeline.

  The platform also exposes a [[http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-platform-api/en/latest/course_structure/index.html][set of API]] to get all the courses that are being
  run on a platform. 

* Plan
** TODO Deployment of Pipeline
   Due Date :: [2016-02-04 Thu]
   
** TODO Analytics Data API
   Analytics Data API provides a mechanism to access the store created by
   Pipeline via HTTP. 
   Due Date :: [2016-02-05 Fri]

* Progress
  - [2016-02-04 Thu] :: edx Analytics Data API is deployed on a container
       (16180) on 10.4.12.24 (base4) and the API tested out.  The lowest level
       of activity that can be retrieved by this API is 'Get the View Count for
       a Subsection'.
  - [2016-02-04 Thu] :: Able to use the [[http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-platform-api/en/latest/course_structure/course_structure.html#get-a-list-of-courses][course API]] to retrieve course
       information from the Open edX platform.
