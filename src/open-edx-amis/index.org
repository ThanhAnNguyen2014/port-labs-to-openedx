* Objective
  To take regular backups of the state of VLABS Open edX twice a
  month. Since labs are already version controlled, the only backup
  required is for Open edX platform.
  
* Problem 
  VLABS Open edX is running outside the cluster due to the following
  reasons -
  + It is not autodeployable.
  + Since we are using un-recommended Ubuntu 14.04, processes of
    installing Open edX is not stable and hence cannot be automated.
  + Making Open edX would take significant amount of efforts and a lot
    of hit and trail explorations.
  
* Solution 
  Above problem can be easily solved by making an AMI (Amazon Machine
  Instance) out of existing VLABS Open edX. Following are the
  advantages of having an AMI -
  + AMI is a ready to launch image of a Amazon Virtual Machine. If you
    running instance goes down or is corrupted, you can immediately
    launch a VM out of AMI and get your instance up and running in
    same state again.
  + It is a full backup of complete VM instance and hence no need of
    seperate backups.
  + Its easy to restore, i.e. by just launching the VM out of AMI.

* Steps to Create an AMI of VLABS Open edX
  + Login to AWS web console.
  + Change your region to California.
  + Select the =vlabs.ac.in VLABS Open edX in production= .
  + Right click and select =image= and then =create image=.
  + A dialog box will appear requesting for the following information.
    + Image name =VLABS Open edX AMI <DATE>=
    + Image description =give some valid description to image=
    + Check / Select =No Reboot= option. If you do not select this,
      current instance will be rebooted.
    + Click =Create instance= button.
  + Visit AMIs section in =Images=
  + Check if AMI is created and give a name to AMI if there is no name
    in name field.
