* Introduction
  This document describes the requirements, design, and implementation
  of analytics service for labs on Open edX.

* Requirements 
** Stake holder requirements 
   + Usage ::
     Number of usages for each experiment in a lab.

* Reasons for not using Open edX insigts analytics system 
  + Open edX Insights was tried by Systems and development team was
    found to be displaying inconsistent data in dashboard. Hence was
    not repeatable.
  + Efforts for the same are captured [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/tree/develop/src/analytics-setup][here]].
  + While the effort was made during the period of April 2016 to July
    2016, insights might have matured to be working fine.
  + One cannot customize the type of analytics required and hence out
    of the box solution was required.
  + Updates are tiresome and risky. Using Insights of Open edX could
    have caused serious problems in updations.
  + The data used as an input to Insights was only readable by
    Insights application. In case we want to run out analytics on the
    same set of data, it could have required a complex system to do
    so.


* Design Diagram 
  Design diagram and documentation is available [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/vlabs-analytics-api-server/blob/master/src/design/index.org][here]].
