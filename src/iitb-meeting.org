#+Title: Skype meeting with IIT-Bombay Openedx Team 
#+Date: <2016-04-21 Thu>

* Introduction
  This document describes the discussion we had with IIT-Bombay team
  over skype to discuss edx related issues.

* Agenda
  1. How to setup oauth between lms and analytics
  2. How to customize and styling lms

* Efforts
  We have setup lms dogwood.0 (52.67.4.199) and customized it. We have
  setup analytics dogwood.0 (52.67.21.94).

* Mrs Sukla's suggestions 
  - Install edx with all necessary modules like course_discovery,
     oauth_client_setup,

  - Create dns names for lms, insights & preferrably cms services

  - Create the ssl certificates for both lms & insights on the
    respective machines under /etc/nginx/ssl directory

  - Change the configuration files for lms, insights under the
    /edx/app/nginx/sites­available on both machines for https protocol
    which will use the above certificates

  - Change the configuration files for lms & insights on respective
    machine. Configuration file for lms is
    /edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json & for insights is
    /edx/etc/insights.yml to reflect the proper urls.

  - Edit the properties of trusted insights client created during
    installation using the lms admin,change the urls with the correct
    url (url & redirect url)

  - Synchronize the computer times of both insights & edx machine using
    'ntp'

  - Append the lms nginx certificate to the file
    /edx/app/insights/venvs/insights/lib/pyhton2.7/requests/cacert.pem

  - Restart all services under supervisorctl & nginx service on both
    machines
* Things to do based on Mrs Sukla feedback and suggestions
  1. Sync time on both the machines.
  2. Create https protcol certificate.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ssl on;
     ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/lmsserver.crt;
     ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/lmsserver.key;
     #+END_EXAMPLE
  3. Set DNS names for both the machines.
  4. Copying public key of lms to insights machine.

* Summary
  1. We have one hour skype call session.
  2. Suklaji will send the document on steps she followed to setup
     insights. We need to follow those steps.
  3. We can go to IIT-Bombay she is available next week.
  4. She will get back to us with the contact of people working on
     customization.
  5. Suklaji seems to have very good knowledge of edx.
