* Introduction
  This document describes few problems encountered during installation of
  platform and creation of course. 

* Problems

** Installation Problem
   During platform installation, the installation fails saying no file
   =/edx/app/edx_notes_api/edx_notes_api/requirements/optional.txt= found.
   This is solved by creating the file and running the playbook. 
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   touch /edx/app/edx_notes_api/edx_notes_api/requirements/optional.txt
   #+END_EXAMPLE
